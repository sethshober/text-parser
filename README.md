New Relic Coding Challenge

The program can be written in any language but should be easy to run.
It should accept as arguments a list of one or more file paths (e.g. ./solution file1.txt file2.txt ...). The program also accepts input on stdin (e.g. cat file1.txt | ./solution).
Alternatively, it is okay to write the solution as a web application with a GUI.
The program outputs a list of the 100 most common three word sequences in the text, along with a count of how many times each occurred in the text.
For example:

231 - i will not
116 - i do not
105 - there is no
54 - i know not
37 - i am not
...
The program ignores punctuation, line endings, and is case insensitive (e.g. "I love\nsandwiches." should be treated the same as "(I LOVE SANDWICHES!!)")
The program is capable of processing large files and runs as fast as possible.
You should push to GitHub at least three times.

// Problem: We need to output the top 100 three word sentences along with a count of times occurred, from files given.
	// It ignores punctuation, line endings, and is case insensitive.
	// It should be capable of processing large files and run fast.
// Solution: We will use node because it excels at fast I/O.
	// We can utilize streams, and pass file path in via process.argv
	// We will split the buffer into sentences, and then determine which ones are three words.
	// Now we can 'sanitize' our remaining sentences. ( remove punctuation and line returns and coerce to lower case )
	// Now that we have valid sentences we can add them to a hash table, setting the value to 1. If we have a match we add one to the value.
	// We now have a count of all three word sentences and do a sort and display to the output.

# text-parser

Command line utility to take in flat files and print out the top 100 three word sequences with count, ignoring punctuation, line endings, and being case insensitive.

Current support is for flat `.txt` files only. For your convenience there is a `files` folder. I recommend `TheCompleteWorksOfWilliamShakespeare.txt`.

Usage: `node index.js [file1]`

Example Printout:

5 - i like cheeseburgers

4 - i run trails

1 - do the javascript
